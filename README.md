# ShadowFox
Web Development internship

1-month internship as a Web Developer Intern at Shadow Fox. During this enriching experience, I had the opportunity to work on various projects, including:

My Portfolio Website â€“ Designed and developed a responsive and user-friendly portfolio showcasing my skills and projects.
Flipkart Clone â€“ Built a functional e-commerce website prototype, demonstrating features like product listing, cart management, and responsive design.
The internship provided me with hands-on exposure to real-world web development challenges. I am grateful for the invaluable guidance and mentorship from the experienced professionals at Shadow Fox, which helped me enhance my technical skills and grow as a developer.

Looking forward to applying this knowledge and contributing to impactful projects in the future! ðŸš€
